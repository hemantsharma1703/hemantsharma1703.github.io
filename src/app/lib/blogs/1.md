# Hello World

This is my first blog post that I am writing using Markdown in Next.js!

I built this blog using Next.js and Markdown. I am using the `gray-matter` library to parse the front matter of the markdown files and `remark` and `remark-html` to parse the markdown content.

## Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain-text-formatting syntax. It is often used to format readme files, for writing messages in online discussion forums, and to create rich text using a plain text editor.

## Next.js

Next.js is a React framework that enables functionality such as server-side rendering and generating static websites for React-based web applications.

I hope you like this blog post. Stay tuned for more posts!
